## Experience

### Founder & Principal Consultant, Salish Sea Wolf LLC

Washington (Remote) · May 2026 to Present

*Independent infrastructure and AI-engineering consultancy; sole principal.*

- Founded an independent infrastructure and AI-engineering consultancy, handling
  scoping, delivery, and operations as sole principal.
- Retained on contract by Silicon Technologies Inc. after departing the company,
  at their request, to continue supporting and extending the infrastructure I
  built there.
- Build custom AI agents and agent harnesses for a confidential client,
  targeting specialized industry workflows.
- Perform LLM evaluation and training-data work through DataAnnotation: prompt
  design, response ranking, and authoring reference code solutions across model
  comparisons.
- Design and operate a production K3s / Argo CD GitOps cluster on Hetzner under
  a single-operator model: Authentik SSO with enforced MFA; step-ca private PKI;
  CloudNativePG; and a Grafana / Loki / Prometheus observability stack. Source
  is public; see [Selected Projects](#selected-projects).

### Software & Infrastructure Architect, Silicon Technologies Inc.

Midvale, UT · July 2014 to May 2026

*Analog integrated-circuit design software for DoD/DoE and commercial workflows.*

Third employee; grew from individual contributor into the architect and
leadership role as the company scaled, owning company-wide development
operations across both software and hardware design.

- **AI & High-Availability Infrastructure:** Engineered and deployed
  high-availability Kubernetes clusters and RAG-backed AI agents that bridged
  legacy engineering tools with modern containerized workflows.
- **Scalable System Architecture:** Architected a CAD application suite that cut
  analog integrated-circuit design time by 10x, integrating Intel and IBM IP and
  services alongside other PDK and EDA tool vendors; independently evaluated by
  Sandia National Laboratories and Mayo Clinic.
- **Technical Leadership:** Grew the Software and IT department from a solo role
  to a team of eight, establishing rapid-development policy and mentoring junior
  engineers through high-pressure delivery cycles.
- **DevOps & Automation:** Ran full-stack operations with Ansible, Terraform
  / OpenTofu, and Proxmox, building the CI/CD pipelines in Gitea Actions on a
  self-hosted Gitea forge and automating distributed storage (SeaweedFS) for
  arbitrary container jobs.
- **Security & Compliance:** Led the organization-wide infrastructure program
  to meet NIST 800-171 / CMMC 2.0, and successfully defended against a remote
  intrusion attempt.
- **Product Modernization:** Transformed a single-file monolith into a modular,
  market-ready product, securing approved U.S. patents for novel design
  methodologies.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Served as technical liaison to federal
  agencies (MDA, U.S. Air/Space Force), enterprise partners (Intel, Sandia,
  Globalfoundries) and co-presented at industry conferences to drive product
  adoption.

## Selected Projects

### k3s-service-cluster

[github.com/salishseawolf/k3s-service-cluster](https://github.com/salishseawolf/k3s-service-cluster)

*Hetzner Cloud, OpenTofu, Ansible, K3s, Argo CD, Traefik, Authentik,
CloudNativePG, SeaweedFS, VolSync, 1Password Operator, Prometheus, Loki,
Grafana*

A three-node, highly available K3s cluster that runs Salish Sea Wolf LLC's
services (source hosting and CI, SSO, document management, time tracking,
analytics, and this site), built and operated entirely as code.

- **GitOps end to end:** OpenTofu provisions servers, network, load balancer,
  and DNS; Ansible bootstraps K3s once; Argo CD reconciles every component
  from git, with no manual `kubectl apply` step.
- **Gated rollout:** five Argo CD sync waves, with a storage canary that must
  mount a real SeaweedFS volume before any application starts.
- **Security:** secrets committed only as 1Password references; Authentik SSO
  with forward-auth on every private route; Pod Security Admission
  `restricted`, default-deny NetworkPolicies, and etcd encryption at rest.
- **Resilience:** three-instance CloudNativePG with daily backups and hourly
  VolSync / restic volume backups to Backblaze B2, each volume under its own
  scoped key.
- **Operations:** CI renders and lints every Helm chart (kubeconform,
  kube-linter), validates OpenTofu and Ansible, and scans history with
  gitleaks.

## Selected Achievements

- Built the Software & IT organization from a single seat into a
  multidisciplinary team, and wrote the procedures that made it the company's
  highest-throughput group.
- Delivered production systems at six-nines availability.
- Inherited the flagship product as a single-file monolith with no function
  decomposition and shipped it as a supportable, sellable commercial product.
- Took a loosely assembled small-company IT setup and rebuilt it as
  enterprise-grade infrastructure at NIST 800-171 / CMMC 2.0 readiness.
- Balanced company infrastructure across cloud and on-premise for both cost
  and resilience.
